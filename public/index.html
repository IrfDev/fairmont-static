                  This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) governs your use of
                  the fairmontstaytus.com website (the “FairmontStaytus
                  Website”) and the software applications for mobile devices
                  owned by Staytus (collectively, the “Fairmont Staytus App”).
                  The Staytus Website and the Fairmont Staytus App (separately
                  or collectively, the “Service”) are provided, owned and
                  operated by Staytus Ltd (BVI) (“Staytus”, “us” or “we”).
                </p>
                <h3 class="">Introduction:</h3>
                <p class="">
                  The Service is designed for use by guests, visitors, and
                  prospective guests (each a “Subscriber”) of hotels and
                  resorts. The Fairmont Staytus App provides time-sensitive
                  information, messages, privileges, discounts, limited-time
                  offers and other information (the “Information”) from a hotel
                  or resort property that is a member of the Fairmont Staytus
                  program (the “Member Hotel”) to a Subscriber. The Information
                  is sent to the Fairmont Staytus App through a combination of
                  background content updates and occasional push notifications
                  according to the Subscriber’s link to a Member Hotel. The
                  Subscriber’s link to a Member Hotel may be governed by the
                  mobile device’s physical proximity to such Member Hotel, the
                  Subscriber’s manually-chosen selection, and/or whether the
                  Fairmont Staytus App has scanned an Invitation Key from such
                  Member Hotel.
                </p>

                <p class="">
                  We obtain information provided by the Subscriber when the
                  Subscriber registers his or her account via the Fairmont
                  Staytus App or signs in via the Fairmont Staytus Website. Some
                  benefits provided by the Fairmont Staytus App are available
                  only to registered Subscribers. You become a Subscriber if you
                  download and sign into the Fairmont Staytus App using your

                <p class="">
                  We collect device location information if you use our location
                  features, which enable the Fairmont Staytus App to determine
                  your current location in order to identify the Member Hotel
                  where you are located and display relevant Information that
                  you may use while you are visiting that specific hotel or
                  resort , and for diagnostics and troubleshooting purposes such
                  as if you are having trouble with our app’s location features.
                  We use various technologies to determine location, including

                  your location information or share your current location with
                  other users or any other third parties. If you do not want us

                  should turn off the location services for the Fairmont Staytus
                  App. You may turn on or off location services in your mobile
                  phone settings. However please note that if you turn off
                  location services, you may not be able to avail of the

                  Automatically Collected Information for as long as you use the
                  Fairmont Staytus App and for a reasonable time thereafter.
                  Please note that some or all of the Subscriber Provided Data
                  may be required in order for the Service to function properly
                  or completely.<br class="" />

                  parents to supervise their children so that they do not
                  disclose any personal information about themselves. We cannot
                  prevent minors from using the Service. We must rely on

                  appropriate for such children to view and/or purchase/redeem.
